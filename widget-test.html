        <h1>The Art of Speed Reading</h1>
        <p>Speed reading is a collection of methods used to increase the rate at which text is read while maintaining comprehension. The techniques typically involve eliminating subvocalization, reducing fixation time, and expanding the visual span. Studies have shown that trained readers can process information at rates of 400-700 words per minute while maintaining reasonable comprehension.</p>

        <p>One popular technique is RSVP, or Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. This method displays one word at a time in a fixed position, eliminating the need for eye movement across the page. Research suggests that a significant portion of reading time is spent on saccadic eye movements between words, and RSVP eliminates this overhead entirely.</p>

        <p>The Optimal Recognition Point, often called the ORP, is a key concept in speed reading. Studies have found that readers do not fixate on the center of words, but rather slightly to the left of center. By highlighting this anchor point, readers can more quickly recognize and process each word.</p>

        <p>Critics of speed reading argue that comprehension necessarily suffers at higher speeds. However, proponents counter that with practice, the brain adapts to processing information more efficiently. The key is finding the right balance between speed and comprehension for your specific reading goals.</p>

        <p>Modern technology has made speed reading more accessible than ever. Applications can track your progress, adjust speed dynamically based on word complexity, and provide analytics on your reading habits. These tools help readers gradually increase their speed while monitoring comprehension.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Speed Reading</h2>
        <p>The ability to read faster has numerous practical applications. Students can work through academic material more efficiently. Professionals can stay current with industry publications. Researchers can quickly scan papers to determine relevance. In our information-rich world, the ability to process text quickly is an invaluable skill.</p>

        <p>Beyond practical applications, speed reading can make the reading experience more enjoyable. When you are not struggling with the mechanics of reading, you can focus more fully on the content. Many speed readers report feeling more engaged with material because they maintain a faster cognitive flow.</p>

    <h2>Test: Inline Mode Widget</h2>
    <div id="inline-reader" class="inline-widget-container"></div>

    <!-- Button mode widget (default) -->
    <script src="dist/speed-reader-widget.js"></script>

    <!-- Inline mode widget -->
    <script>
        // Create an inline widget in the container
        const inlineWidget = new SpeedReaderWidget({
