# Anchor Positioning Test

Use these test phrases to verify the anchor letter stays in the same position:

## Test 1: Short to Long Words

```
I am the best speed reader in the world and I can read very fast
```

Watch how:
- "I" (anchor: I)
- "am" (anchor: a)
- "the" (anchor: t)
- "best" (anchor: e)
- "speed" (anchor: p)
- "reader" (anchor: e)

The anchor letter (shown in red) should stay in the exact same horizontal position while the words shift left and right around it.

## Test 2: Variable Word Lengths

```
a dog ran quickly through the magnificent countryside yesterday
```

Notice:
- Short words like "a" and "dog" 
- Medium words like "quickly" and "through"
- Long words like "magnificent" and "countryside"

All have their anchor letter appearing at the SAME fixed position on screen.

## Test 3: Similar Words

```
read reading reader readable readability
```

Perfect for seeing how words of increasing length shift progressively to the left as they get longer, but the anchor stays put.

## Visual Anchor Test

You should see a faint red vertical line in the reading area. This marks where the anchor letter always appears. Words with:

- **Short length** (1-3 letters): Centered around the anchor
- **Medium length** (4-8 letters): Anchor is about 1/3 from the left  
- **Long words** (9+ letters): Anchor is about 1/3 from the left

The word positioning shifts, but the red anchor letter never moves!

## How to Verify

1. Start reading any test text above
2. Put a small sticker or mark on your screen at the red anchor position
3. Watch words flow - the red letter should always touch your mark
4. Your eyes should NEVER move - just stay focused on the anchor point

## Expected Behavior

✓ Red anchor letter stays in fixed position  
✓ Words shift left for longer words  
✓ Words shift right for shorter words  
✓ Your eyes never need to move  
✓ Smooth, effortless reading experience  

## Common Issues

❌ If words seem centered (not anchor-aligned):
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
- Refresh the page
- Try a different browser

❌ If the anchor moves around:
- This shouldn't happen - please report as a bug

The whole point of RSVP is that you find ONE spot on the screen, focus on it, and never move your eyes!
